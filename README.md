# About
## Game: Tic~Tac~Toe
### A simple tic tac toe game that allows for the user to sign up, and sign in. The player can also continue to reset the game and play multiple times without the page refreshing. In the future, I would like to add multiplayer features and the option to play against a bot.


# Planning

### Before beginning to write out code, I first drew wireframes and user stories. The design, and overall styling for this game was inspired by a past project that I worked on last summer called "SO Many Numbers." The problem solving for the logic portion of the game, was first drawn out on paper and then written in pseudo code before being transferred to actual Javascript. With the help of instructors, classmates, and our SEI issue tracker; I was able to figure out my game plan!

# User stories
1. As a user, I want to be able to create an account.
2. As a user, I want to be able to change my password.
2. As a user, I want to pick a side (either x or o)
3. As a user, I want to be able to play a new game right away without the page refreshing.
4. As a user, I want to see my past scores.
5. As a user, I want to see when I have won, lost or tied in this game.
6. As a user, I want to be able to log out when I am done playing this game.

# Plans for the future!
 ### The plans for this game are to add a bot, and add a multiplayer option. I would also like to add some animation to the game board, and make it so the winner's x or o (depending on what they chose)  bounce up and down when they have won the game.
